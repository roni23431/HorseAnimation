Horse Animation
This is a simple JavaScript code snippet to generate an animated running horse on a canvas element in a web browser.

Usage
Ensure you have an HTML file with a <canvas> element with the id "canvas" where you want the horse animation to appear.
Replace 'horse.png' in the code with the actual path to your horse image.
Include the provided index.js file in your project.
Description
The code defines a Horse class that represents a running horse. It takes the initial position (x, y) and speed as parameters. The horse's image is loaded from the provided path, and the animation is handled using the update() and draw() methods.

Animation
The horse moves horizontally across the canvas from left to right. When it reaches the right edge of the canvas, it reappears from the left side to create a continuous running effect.
